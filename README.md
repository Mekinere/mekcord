# mekcord
Vencord custom theme WIP

# how
There are three(four) things you can pick from, basically.

# theme
I figured out how themes work yay me

<ol> <b>Heres the quick way. this is NOT editable, however. </b>
  <li>
    install <a href="https://vencord.dev/" target="_blank">Vencord</a> if you haven't already, following their install instructions    
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to User Settings (gear button) in Discord
  </li>
  <li>
    find the Vencord section of settings, and click on "Themes", then click on "Online Themes"
  </li>
  <li>
    copy paste this link: 
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mekinere/mekcord/refs/heads/main/mekcord.theme.css
  </li>
  <li>
    click out of the textbox. If it says at the bottom 'Valid!' in green letters it worked.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol> <b>Heres the slightly longer way </b>
  <li>
    install <a href="https://vencord.dev/" target="_blank">Vencord</a> if you haven't already, following their install instructions    
  </li>
  <li>
    download <a href="https://github.com/Mekinere/mekcord/blob/main/mekcord.theme.css" target="_blank">the theme file</a> from this repository
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to User Settings (gear button) in Discord
  </li>
  <li>
    find the Vencord section of settings, and click on "Themes"
  </li>
  <li>
    click on 'Open Themes Folder', which doesn't open the themes folder
  </li>
  <li>
    double click on the actual themes folder
  </li>
  <li>
    drag and drop the css file into the folder
  </li>
  <li>
    go back to discord and click on 'Load missing Themes'
  </li>
  <li>
    turn the switch to 'on'. If it does not work either you or I have done something wrong :'>
  </li>
</ol>

# import
If you want my exact settings this is a choice you can make
<ol>
  <li>
    install <a href="https://vencord.dev/" target="_blank">Vencord</a> if you haven't already, following their install instructions
  </li>
  <li>
    download <a href="https://github.com/Mekinere/mekcord/blob/main/mekcord_settings.json" target="_blank">mekcord_settings.json</a> from this repository
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to User Settings (gear button) in Discord
  </li>
  <li> find the Vencord section of settings, and click on "Backup and Restore"</li>
  <li>
    click on "Import Settings"
  </li>
  <li>
    select mekcord_settings.json, which you have downloaded. If it is not downloaded, go back to step 2
  </li>
  <li>
    restart discord! now you're done
  </li>
</ol>

# copy-paste
If you have nitro and just want the CSS/prefer plugin-less vencord
<ol>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://vencord.dev/" target="_blank">Vencord</a> if you haven't already, following their install instructions
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to User Settings (gear button) in Discord
  </li>
  <li> find the Vencord section of settings, and click on Vencord</li>
  <li> click "Enable Custom CSS", and click on "Edit QuickCSS"</li>
  <li>
    Come back to this github, and open up <a href="https://github.com/Mekinere/mekcord/blob/main/src/mekcord.css" target="_blank">mekcord.css</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    copy and paste everything written in there into the QuickCSS window that opened in step 4
  </li>
  <li>
    close the quickCSS window because you're done
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
Alternatively, when you download the theme, just pop open that file really quick and delete the line that says 'import no_nitro'

# why
I can't stand all the visual redesign stuff; its frankly quite sloppy, even though there are some good features wrapped in there (larger title bar, adjustable server sidebar) it feels like they didn't consider clean layout to be important.

# what
currently, just a export of my settings/quickly made css powered by frustration. Currently through the JSON, I have these plugins enabled:
<ul>
  <li>Better Gif Alt Text</li>
  
  <li>Better Gif Picker</li>

  <li>Better Role Context</li>

  <li>Better Sessions</li>

  <li>Better Settings</li>

  <li>Bigger Stream Preview</li>

  <li>Call Timer</li>

  <li>Copy File Contents</li>

  <li>Crash Handler</li>
  
  <li>Emote Cloner</li>
  
  <li>Fake Nitro</li>
  
  <li>Fix Spotify Embeds</li>
  
  <li>FixYoutubeEmbeds</li>  

</ul>
  AND MORE <br>
  this list is actually really long ill continue this later probably

# HELP
If you are good at color theory or know a bit more about how discord/vencord actually works I want to make a full fledged theme at some point <br>
Especially if you are good with color please help me something is wrong and I don't know what it feels almost eye straining to look at the text on discord <br>
But also if you have any suggestions or ideas just DM me on discord @mekinere I'm kind of out of ideas so I've just been tweaking stuff here and there, making some stuff bigger/smaller and lining up sections that were a pixel or two off
