# mekcord
Vencord custom theme WIP

# why
I can't stand all the visual redesign stuff; its frankly quite sloppy, even though there are some good features wrapped in there (larger title bar, adjustable server sidebar) it feels like they didn't consider clean layout to be important.

# what
currently, just a export of my settings/quickly made css powered by frustration for <a href="https://vencord.dev/">Vencord</a>. Currently through the JSON, I have these plugins enabled:
<ul>
  <li>Better Gif Alt Text</li>
  
  <li>Better Gif Picker</li>

  <li>Better Role Context</li>

  <li>Better Sessions</li>

  <li>Better Settings</li>

  <li>Bigger Stream Preview</li>

  <li>Call Timer</li>

  <li>Copy File Contents</li>

  <li>Crash Handler</li>
  
  <li>Emote Cloner</li>
  
  <li>Fake Nitro</li>
  
  <li>Fix Spotify Embeds</li>
  
  <li>FixYoutubeEmbeds</li>  

</ul>
  AND MORE <br>
  this list is actually really long ill continue this later probably

# HELP
If you are good at color theory or know a bit more about how discord/vencord actually works I want to make a full fledged theme at some point <br>
Especially if you are good with color please help me something is wrong and I don't know what it feels almost eye straining to look at the text on discord <br>
But also if you have any suggestions or ideas just DM me on discord @mekinere I'm kind of out of ideas so I've just been tweaking stuff here and there, making some stuff bigger/smaller and lining up sections that were a pixel or two off
